Do the opposite. Start the move with your hips slightly away from the wall. Drive them actively toward the wall while standing up, so you are closest to the wall at the highest point of the move.

Put your full attention on how your toe meets the hold: on small footholds the tip of your big toe, actively searching and gripping. On slopers, drop the heel and smear. Notice how pressing through your foot moves your hip.',

Then reverse: drive through your legs, pull your hips back toward the wall and catch the hold at the highest, weightless point of the move. The power comes from your legs; your hand follows.

    do:'Pause at every hold and feel which way it points. Deliberately shift your weight the opposite way — a right-facing sidepull means mass to the left. Lock yourself into that tensioned position before reaching on, and hold the tension while moving to the next hold. Only then adjust your feet. Strongest on slopers and pinches, but apply it on good holds too — that is where energy quietly leaks away.',

Work in isometric holds of 7 to 10 seconds at around 80 to 90 percent of your max — heavy, but stop 1 to 2 counts before failure. Rest 2 to 3 minutes fully between sets. 4 to 6 sets. Feel your forearm and fingers actively working the whole hold, not passively hanging off the tendons.',

Feel free to borrow holds from neighbouring routes if they fit better. Not everything works out? A handful of good repetitions is already a win.',

    setup:'Boulders 1-2 grades below onsight, climb up first.',

Harder: pick footholds that demand a high step or precarious balance. Do not take your eye off the hold until your foot sits perfectly.',

    setup:'Slab wall with big holds.',
    do:'Place your foot on the wall where there is no foothold and use it as if there were one. Press your foot into the wall and pull yourself up on the holds — the tension between pulling arms and pushing feet carries you. Climb up and back down until smearing feels familiar.',

Pull yourself into the wall until your left shoulder touches or hovers at the left hold. Right hip up and close to the wall, right knee pointing right. Hold 10 sec, relax — one rep. Switch sides.',

Tendons respond to isometric load for about ten minutes, then the cells stop responding; more is not better, just more wear. So this caps at ten minutes whatever round you reach. Static holds only, no bounce, light to moderate at roughly 50 percent or less, always pain-free. Ideally a session of its own, morning or pre-training, and you can repeat it after six hours or more.
